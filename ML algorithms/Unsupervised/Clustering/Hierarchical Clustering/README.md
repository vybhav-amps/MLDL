# Hierarchical Clustering Project Overview

## Introduction to Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters. It is used to group similar objects into clusters where no prior knowledge of the number of clusters is required.

### Concept of Hierarchical Clustering

The algorithm builds a hierarchy of clusters either by a bottom-up approach (agglomerative) or a top-down approach (divisive). Agglomerative is more common, where each data point starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.

## Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm

1. **Start by treating each data point as a single cluster.**
2. **Find the closest (most similar) pair of clusters and merge them into a single cluster.**
3. **Compute distances between clusters and repeat step 2 until all data points are clustered into a single cluster.**

### Mathematical Foundation

The choice of distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan) and linkage criteria (e.g., Ward, Maximum, Average) critically influences the shape of the clusters.

## Graphical Representation

### Dendrogram

A tree-like diagram that records the sequences of merges or splits. The height of the splits or merges represents the distance or dissimilarity between clusters.

### Cluster Visualization

Scatter plots or other visualizations showing the clusters usually for 2D or 3D data for visual interpretation.

## Use Cases of Hierarchical Clustering

- **Biological Sciences:** For classifying plants or animals into taxonomies.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.
- **Document Clustering:** Organizing a set of documents into clusters of similar topics.

## Challenges in Hierarchical Clustering

- **Computational Complexity:** Especially for large datasets.
- **Determining the Number of Clusters:** Requires analysis of the dendrogram.
- **Sensitivity to Noise and Outliers:** Can affect the structure of the dendrogram.

## Conclusion

Hierarchical clustering is a powerful tool in data analysis for uncovering underlying patterns or structures in data. It is particularly useful for exploratory data analysis and understanding hierarchical structures in data.
