# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Project Overview

## Introduction to K-Nearest Neighbors

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, yet powerful algorithm used in machine learning for both classification and regression. It operates on the principle that similar data points are likely to be in close proximity to each other.

### Concept of KNN

KNN works by finding the 'k' nearest data points to a given data point in the feature space and making predictions based on these nearest neighbors. In classification, KNN predicts the class of the data point by majority vote of its neighbors. In regression, it predicts the value based on the average of the values of its neighbors.

## KNN Algorithm

1. **Choosing the Number of Neighbors (k):** Select the number 'k' which represents the number of nearest neighbors to consider.
2. **Distance Calculation:** Calculate the distance between the data point to be predicted and all other points in the dataset.
3. **Find Nearest Neighbors:** Identify the 'k' nearest neighbors to the data point.
4. **Prediction:** 
   - In classification, use majority voting among the k-neighbors.
   - In regression, use the average or median of the k-neighbors' values.

### Distance Metrics

Common distance metrics used in KNN:
- Euclidean Distance
- Manhattan Distance
- Minkowski Distance

### Mathematical Formula

- Euclidean Distance: \( \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2} \)
- Manhattan Distance: \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i| \)

### Scatter Plot

Shows the data points in the feature space, highlighting the neighbors of a prediction point.

### Decision Boundary

For classification, a plot showing the decision boundary based on the neighbors.

## Use Cases of KNN

1. **Recommendation Systems:** Suggesting products or content based on similarity to user's preferences.
2. **Medical Diagnosis:** Classifying patients' conditions based on similar patient records.
3. **Financial Fraud Detection:** Identifying fraudulent activities by comparing with known fraud patterns.

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Choice of k:** Selecting the right value of k is crucial for the model's performance.
- **Curse of Dimensionality:** Performance degrades with an increase in the number of features.
- **Scaling:** KNN requires feature scaling for effective performance.
- **Computationally Intensive:** As the dataset grows, the computation cost increases.

## Conclusion

K-Nearest Neighbors is a versatile algorithm suitable for various practical applications in both classification and regression. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it a popular choice, especially in cases where the data is not linearly separable.
