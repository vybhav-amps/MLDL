# Regression Machine Learning Algorithms Overview

## Introduction to Regression in Machine Learning

Regression analysis is a predictive modeling technique for analyzing the relationships between a dependent (target) variable and one or more independent (predictor) variables. The goal is to model the expected value of the target variable as a function of the predictors.

### Purpose of Regression

The main purpose of regression in machine learning is to estimate the relationships between variables, forecast an outcome, and determine the strength of predictors.

## Types of Regression Algorithms

### 1. Linear Regression

- **Concept:** Models the linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **Use Cases:** Sales forecasting, risk assessment.

### 2. Polynomial Regression

- **Concept:** Extends linear regression by adding polynomial terms, allowing for more complex relationships.
- **Use Cases:** Analysis of non-linear trends in data.

### 3. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)

- **Concept:** Addresses multicollinearity in linear regression by adding a penalty term.
- **Use Cases:** When data suffers from multicollinearity.

### 4. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

- **Concept:** Similar to Ridge but can shrink coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.
- **Use Cases:** Model selection and regularization to prevent overfitting.

### 5. Elastic Net Regression

- **Concept:** Combines L1 and L2 regularization methods.
- **Use Cases:** When both feature selection and multicollinearity are concerns.


## Key Concepts in Regression Analysis

- **Overfitting vs. Underfitting:** Balancing the model to make it neither too simple nor too complex.
- **Regularization:** Techniques like Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net to prevent overfitting.
- **Assumptions:** Each regression model has its own set of assumptions which should be met for optimal performance.

## Evaluation Metrics for Regression

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R-squared and Adjusted R-squared**

## Conclusion

Regression analysis is a powerful statistical tool for modeling and analyzing the relationships between variables. It has widespread applications in economics, engineering, biology, and many other fields.
