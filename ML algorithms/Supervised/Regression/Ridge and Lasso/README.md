# Ridge and Lasso Regression Project Overview

## Introduction to Ridge and Lasso Regression

Ridge and Lasso regression are techniques used for creating linear models that are robust to overfitting. They introduce a regularization term to the loss function to constrain the model coefficients.

### Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)

Ridge Regression adds a penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. It helps to reduce model complexity and multicollinearity.

### Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

Lasso Regression adds a penalty equivalent to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. It can lead to sparse models where some coefficients can become zero, effectively selecting more important features.

## Ridge and Lasso Regression Algorithms

### Ridge Regression Algorithm

1. **Loss Function:** Ordinary Least Squares Loss + L2 Regularization Term.
2. **Regularization Term:** λ(sum of squares of coefficients), where λ is a complexity parameter.
3. **Feature Importance:** Keeps all features but shrinks coefficients.

### Lasso Regression Algorithm

1. **Loss Function:** Ordinary Least Squares Loss + L1 Regularization Term.
2. **Regularization Term:** λ(sum of absolute values of coefficients).
3. **Feature Selection:** Can set some coefficients to zero, performing feature selection.

### Coefficient Path

Plot showing the paths of the coefficients as the regularization parameter λ is varied. Useful for understanding the effect of λ on the model coefficients.

### Performance Plot

A plot showing the model's performance (e.g., R-squared value, MSE) against different values of λ.

## Use Cases

- **Ridge:** When you have many small/medium sized effects.
- **Lasso:** When you have a smaller set of significant predictors.

## Challenges in Regularized Regression

- **Selecting λ:** Requires tuning to find the optimal value.
- **Scale Sensitivity:** The scales of the input features affect the regularization strength. Features should be standardized before applying these techniques.
- **Interpretability:** The introduction of the regularization term may make the model more complex to interpret.

## Conclusion

Ridge and Lasso regression are powerful techniques for building more robust linear models, especially useful in scenarios with high multicollinearity or when feature selection is important.
