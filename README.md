## 1. Feature Engineering in Machine Learning Project Overview

### Introduction to Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline. It involves transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.

#### Purpose of Feature Engineering

The main goal of feature engineering is to improve the performance of machine learning models by providing them with input data that contains more meaningful information, which helps the model to understand the patterns better.

### Techniques in Feature Engineering

#### 1. Imputation

- **Concept:** Filling missing values in the dataset.
- **Techniques:** Mean/Median imputation, model-based imputation.

#### 2. Handling Outliers

- **Concept:** Dealing with anomalies in the data that might adversely affect the model.
- **Techniques:** Trimming, capping, transformation.

#### 3. Binning

- **Concept:** Converting continuous features into discrete bins.
- **Techniques:** Equal-width binning, equal-frequency binning.

#### 4. Encoding Categorical Variables

- **Concept:** Converting categorical variables into numerical form.
- **Techniques:** One-hot encoding, label encoding, ordinal encoding.

#### 5. Feature Scaling

- **Concept:** Scaling the range of feature values.
- **Techniques:** Normalization, standardization.

#### 6. Feature Extraction

- **Concept:** Creating new features from existing features (especially in text or image data).
- **Techniques:** PCA, LDA, t-SNE.

#### 7. Feature Selection

- **Concept:** Selecting the most useful features to train the model.
- **Techniques:** Wrapper methods, filter methods, embedded methods.

### Importance of Feature Engineering

- **Improved Model Performance:** Enhances the accuracy and efficiency of the model.
- **Reduction of Complexity:** Helps in simplifying the model by eliminating redundant features.
- **Enhanced Interpretability:** Makes the model outputs more understandable.

### Challenges in Feature Engineering

- **Resource Intensive:** Can be time-consuming and require domain expertise.
- **Risk of Overfitting:** Especially with creating too many or too complex features.
- **Model Dependency:** Some features may work well with certain types of models but not others.

## 2. Machine Learning Overview

### Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building applications that learn from data and improve their accuracy over time without being programmed to do so. ML algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

#### Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning:** The algorithm learns from labeled training data, helps predict outcomes for unforeseen data. Examples: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, etc.
2. **Unsupervised Learning:** Deals with unlabeled data. The system tries to learn the patterns and structure from such data. Examples: K-means clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, etc.
3. **Reinforcement Learning:** The algorithm learns to perform an action from experience. Examples: Markov Decision Process.

### Key Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Supervised Learning Algorithms

1. **Linear Regression:** Used for predicting real-valued output.
2. **Logistic Regression:** Used for binary classification tasks.
3. **Decision Trees:** Non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression.
4. **Random Forest:** An ensemble of decision trees, typically used for classification.
5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Can be used for both regression and classification tasks.
6. **Naive Bayes:** A group of probabilistic algorithms based on applying Bayesâ€™ theorem with strong independence assumptions.

#### Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

1. **K-Means Clustering:** A simple and widely-used clustering algorithm.
2. **Hierarchical Clustering:** Builds a cluster hierarchy or a tree of clusters.
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** A dimensionality reduction technique.
4. **Apriori algorithm:** Used for association rule learning.
